## 🎯 Testing Scenarios

### Functional Testing
```bash
# Test basic functionality
python quick_test.py

# Test all features
python test_runner.py
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Test with large datasets
python performance_test.py
```

### Manual Testing Automation
The automated tests cover:
- ✅ Application startup without errors
- ✅ Cart functionality without AttributeError
- ✅ Product windows without geometry conflicts
- ✅ Calculator with exact legacy calculations
- ✅ End-to-end workflow validation

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

### Excellent Performance
- ✅ Cart operations: < 1.0 second
- ✅ Application startup: < 0.5 seconds
- ✅ Calculations: < 0.1 seconds each

### Acceptable Performance
- ⚠️ Cart operations: < 3.0 seconds
- ⚠️ Application startup: < 2.0 seconds
- ⚠️ Calculations: < 0.5 seconds each

### Needs Optimization
- ❌ Anything above acceptable thresholds

## 🔧 Continuous Integration

### Before Each Commit
```bash
python quick_test.py
```

### Before Each Release
```bash
python test_runner.py && python performance_test.py
```

### Automated Testing in CI/CD
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run Quick Tests
  run: python quick_test.py

- name: Run Full Tests
  run: python test_runner.py

- name: Run Performance Tests
  run: python performance_test.py
```

## 🐛 Debugging Failed Tests

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Import Errors**
   ```bash
   # Check Python path
   python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"
   
   # Ensure virtual environment is activated
   # Run from project root directory
   ```

2. **Tkinter Window Issues**
   ```bash
   # Tests run with hidden windows (withdraw())
   # If tests hang, check for modal dialogs
   ```

3. **Performance Test Failures**
   ```bash
   # Check system resources
   # Close other applications
   # Run tests individually
   ```

## 📋 Test Coverage
